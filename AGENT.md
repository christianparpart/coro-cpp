## Design Patterns & Principles

### Error handling: `std::expected<T, E>`
Prefer `std::expected<T, E>` for fallible API surface. The error taxonomy
is split, for example: `NetworkError`, `ProtocolError`, `StorageError`, `ConfigError`.
Chain monadically with `and_then`, `or_else`, `transform`,
`transform_error` rather than nested `if`s. Reserve exceptions for
programmer errors (precondition violation, contract misuse).

### Dependency injection
**This is a load-bearing principle, not a nice-to-have.** Anything that
touches I/O, time, randomness, the filesystem, the network, or any other
ambient/global resource is reached through an interface — never through a
concrete type, a singleton, or a free function with hidden state. 

When you add a component that does I/O or depends on the environment,
**define the interface first and inject it** — do not reach for the
concrete type directly. Use an abstract C++ class or a `std::function<...>` for this.
If you find yourself wanting a global, a `static` mutable, 
or a direct `::time()`/`::read()`/`new ConcreteThing` call in
business logic, that is the signal to introduce (or reuse) a seam instead.
Deviate from this only with a *strong, explicitly stated* reason (e.g. a
genuinely pure leaf computation with no environment coupling); the default
answer is "inject it".

### Data-driven design
**Behaviour is described by data; code interprets that data.** This is
equally load-bearing and goes well beyond "no magic numbers". The aim is
that adding a flag, a protocol verb, a storage backend, or an error code
is a matter of *adding a row to a table*, not editing logic scattered
across the codebase. Concretely:

- **One source of truth per concept.** The CLI flag table is data; the
  storage-record layout is documented and derived in one place; the
  per-DBMS / per-protocol dispatch lives in a single switch each. There is
  exactly one place to change when the concept changes.
- **No naive, hand-rolled repetition.** If two branches differ only by a
  value, lift the value into a descriptor/table and write the logic once.
  Copy-pasted blocks that diverge only in constants, names, or types are a
  defect — replace them with a data table the code iterates over, or a
  small generic helper.
- **Built for extension.** Prefer designs where the next case
  (flag, verb, backend, metric, signal) is a new table entry or a new
  interface implementation, not a new `if`/`else` arm threaded through
  existing functions. Open for extension, closed for invasive modification.
- **Tables over conditionals.** A `switch`/`if` ladder that mirrors a fixed
  set of named things is usually a table in disguise; express it as data
  (a descriptor array, a lookup map, a dispatch table) and drive it with a
  range-based loop or `std::ranges` pipeline.

As with DI, **adhere to this unless there is a very strong, explicitly
justified reason not to.** When in doubt, ask: "if a sixth case showed up
tomorrow, how many places would I edit?" If the answer is more than one,
the design is not data-driven enough yet.

### RAII for resource handles
Sockets, listeners, log files, coroutine handles — every resource is
owned by an RAII wrapper. `PooledBuffer` returns to its `BufferPool` on
destruction; `Task<T>`'s `Awaiter` takes ownership of the coroutine
handle on construction so the temporary `Task` cannot tear the coroutine
down across a suspend point.

## C++ Coding Guidelines

### Baseline (general C++23)
- **Data-driven design (non-negotiable)** — describe behaviour as data and let code interpret it. No hard-coded magic values; no copy-pasted branches that differ only by a constant/name/type; new cases should be a new table row or descriptor, not a new hand-written `if`. Prefer tables/descriptors and `std::ranges` over conditional ladders. See the "Data-driven design" principle above; deviate only with a strong, stated reason.
- **Dependency injection (non-negotiable)** — reach every I/O / time / randomness / filesystem / environment dependency through an injected interface, never a singleton, global, or direct concrete call. Define the seam first, then inject it. See the "Dependency injection" principle above; deviate only with a strong, stated reason.
- **Doxygen** on every new public function (params, return), class, struct, and member:
  ```cpp
  /// Short description.
  /// @param name Description.
  /// @return Description.
  ```
- **`const` correctness** throughout (refs, pointers, member functions).
- **C++23 features** — `constexpr`, `std::ranges`, `std::format`, `std::expected` and its monadic methods (`and_then`, `or_else`, `transform`, `transform_error`).
- **C-style loops are forbidden.** Use range-based `for`, `std::views::iota`, and other range views for generation/transformation.
- **`std::span`** for arrays and contiguous sequences.
- **`auto` type deduction** for readability; **structured bindings** for tuple-like returns.
- **`clang-format` after every change** — use the project `.clang-format`.
- **`clang-tidy` reports must be fixed at the source.** Never silence with `NOLINT` — address the underlying issue. The `clang-debug` preset enables `clang-tidy` automatically.
- **No `k`-prefix on identifiers.** Do not use the Google-style `kFoo` prefix for constants, enumerators, or any other symbol — it violates the project `.clang-tidy` naming convention. Use `Foo` (PascalCase) for constants/enumerators and `foo`/`fooBar` for locals and members instead.
- **All changes covered by unit tests.** Aim to **increase** coverage with every PR.
- **No raw owning pointers.** Use `std::unique_ptr` / `std::shared_ptr` for ownership; RAII for resources.
- **No new third-party dependencies** without strong justification.

### Project-specific additions
- Public headers must be **self-contained** (compile standalone, no PCH dependency).
- Public symbols live in the `FastCache` namespace.
- Mark `std::expected`-returning APIs `[[nodiscard]]`.
- Prefer `std::expected<T, SomeError>` over throwing on the public API surface.

## Testing

Catch2 tests live next to the implementation files, so `Foo.cpp` has a `Foo_test.cpp`. A `test_main.cpp` serves as the entry point.
